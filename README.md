# AI apps

Recently it was brought to my attention that AI assistants are really good at writing complete working programs, such as simple web apps. Since discovering this I've made a bunch of apps that I could've made in a day or two before, but now I can make in ten minutes, or a few hours if I want to polish them. These were all made with ChatGPT or Claude.ai.
